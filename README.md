# Tangleword

[Tangleword](https://starwort.github.io/tangleword/) is a word puzzle game, where crossword-style clues each point to a vertical column. The answer to each clue is a three-letter word, made up from the three letters that the clue points to.

The game is won when all the letters on the right hand side are filled in correctly, without causing any conflicts.

For convenience, an additional view is provided that shows the letters in a grid, rather than with overlapping arrows.

Created due to a call for an interactive version of the puzzle in [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2024/mar/03/can-you-solve-it-the-word-game-at-the-cutting-edge-of-computer-science).
